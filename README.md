## User Story
AS A event goer
I WANT to see local events and nearby popular restaurants
SO THAT I can choose an event that interests me and select a nearby restaurant

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a event dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with top events for that city and restaurants near the event longitude/latitude, and that info is added to the search history
WHEN I view events for that city
Then I am presented with the event name, venue, adress, image, the start-date/time, event description, and URL
WHEN I view nearby restaurants
THEN I am presented with the name, image, address, rating, phone number and URL 
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
