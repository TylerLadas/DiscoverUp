## Purpose
To build a local event dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story
AS AN event goer<br>
I WANT to see local events and nearby popular restaurants<br>
SO THAT I can choose an event that interests me and select a nearby restaurant<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a event dashboard with form inputs<br>
WHEN I search for a city<br>
THEN I am presented with top events for that city and restaurants near the event longitude/latitude, and that info is added to the search history<br>
WHEN I view events for that city<br>
Then I am presented with the event name, venue, adress, image, the start-date/time, event description, and URL<br>
WHEN I view nearby restaurants<br>
THEN I am presented with the name, image, address, rating, phone number and URL <br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history<br>
THEN I am again presented with events and nearby restaurants for that city<br>
WHEN I click clear all<br>
Then I am presented with a cleared local storage and saved events container
